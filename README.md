## Introduction - What is this? 🎁

A website-based application for sharing and collaborating on wishlists and presents. The main goal is to allow the sharing of wishlists and the claiming gift ideas without the recipient knowing what they are receiving.

## FAQ - What mean??? 😕

<b>What does Pønskelisten mean?</b><br>
Just a clever Norwegian wordplay that doesn't translate to English at all. A wishlist is called a 'ønskeliste' in Norwegian, and the verb to 'pønske' which means to plot and plan. Therefore, Pønskelisten.

## The End - Does it work? 🪛
Well, it doesn't. This is in early development and the only reason I am comfortable keeping this repository public is that it probably won't be seen and I am comfortable with my workflow not publishing any secrets/passwords. 

<br>Hopefully, that assumption doesn't bite me in the ass 🤡.
