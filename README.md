## Introduction - What is this? 🎁

A website-based application for sharing and collaborating on wishlists and presents. The main goal is to allow sharing of wishlists and claiming gifts without the recipient knowing what they are receiving.

<br>

## The End - Does it work? 🪛
Well, it doesn't. This is in early development and the only reason I am comfortable keeping this repository public is that it probably won't been seen and I am comfortable with my workflow not publishing any secrets/passwords. 

<br>Hopefully, that assumption doesn't bite me in the ass 🤡.
